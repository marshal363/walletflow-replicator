### 9.3 State Management Challenges

#### Account Switching Flow

**Issue Description:**
The wallet state management system experienced synchronization issues during account switching, specifically:

- Wallet data not updating properly after account switches
- Stale wallet data persisting in the HomeWidgets component
- Race conditions between modal closing and state updates
- Inconsistent state between AccountSwitcher and HomeWidgets components

**Root Causes:**

1. **Timing Issues**

   - State updates occurring before account switch completion
   - Modal closing event not properly synchronized with state changes
   - Lack of proper cleanup for stale wallet data

2. **Component Communication**
   - Disconnected state management between AccountSwitcher and HomeWidgets
   - No direct link between modal closing and wallet synchronization
   - Missing event handling for account switch completion

**Implementation Solution:**

```typescript
// State Management
const [isAccountSwitching, setIsAccountSwitching] = useState(false);
const pendingAccountRef = useRef<Id<"accounts"> | null>(null);
const prevAccountIdRef = useRef<Id<"accounts"> | null>(null);

// Event Handling
useEffect(() => {
  const handleModalClose = () => {
    if (pendingAccountRef.current) {
      // Process pending account change
      setSelectedAccountId(pendingAccountRef.current);
      setIsAccountSwitching(true);
    }
  };

  document.addEventListener("modalclose", handleModalClose);
  return () => document.removeEventListener("modalclose", handleModalClose);
}, []);

// Wallet Synchronization
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedAccountId !== prevAccountIdRef.current) {
    // Clear stale data
    setSelectedWalletId(null);
    // Trigger wallet refresh
    setIsWalletLoading(true);
    prevAccountIdRef.current = selectedAccountId;
  }
}, [selectedAccountId]);
```

**Key Improvements:**

1. **Explicit State Tracking**

   - Added isAccountSwitching flag
   - Implemented pendingAccountRef for tracking changes
   - Added proper state cleanup mechanisms

2. **Event-Based Synchronization**

   - Added modalclose event emission
   - Implemented proper event handling
   - Enhanced state synchronization flow

3. **Enhanced Error Prevention**

   - Added wallet validation checks
   - Implemented proper loading states
   - Added comprehensive logging

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
   - Improved state update batching
   - Enhanced data fetching efficiency

**Logging Implementation:**

```typescript
console.log("üè† HomeWidgets Data:", {
  accountId: selectedAccountId?.toString() || "none",
  accountType: selectedAccount?.type || "unknown",
  walletsCount: wallets?.length || 0,
  isLoading: accountsLoading,
  isAccountSwitching,
});
```

**Best Practices Established:**

1. Always validate wallet belongs to current account
2. Clear stale data during account switches
3. Implement proper loading states
4. Add comprehensive logging for debugging
5. Handle race conditions explicitly
6. Synchronize modal and state changes
7. Maintain proper cleanup mechanisms

**Future Considerations:**

1. Implement optimistic updates for faster UI response
2. Add retry mechanisms for failed state updates
3. Enhance error recovery mechanisms
4. Implement state persistence for better UX
5. Add performance monitoring
6. Enhance debugging capabilities
